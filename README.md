# data-science
Adventures in data science, machine learning etc

- myohddac is a web app to "make your own hand drawn digits and characters" (think MNIST)
- learn-to-fit-curves.ipynb looks at how curves can be approximated with functions made up of linear/non-linear layers
- pytorch-things
    - pytorch-custom-layer.ipynb shows how to create a custom nn.Module and use it in a neural net
    - pytorch-LSUV.ipynb follows on from pytorch-custom-layer.ipynb to see if "model specific weight initialization" improves training
    - calculating-variance.ipynb calculates statistics when a dataset is too big to process in one hit
- fastai-things
    - train-imagenette-mininet.ipynb top of the [imagenette](https://github.com/fastai/imagenette) leaderboard (as of 2020-02-04)
